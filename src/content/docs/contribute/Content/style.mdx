## Writing Style

- Articles should read like an encyclopedia or nonfiction book.
- Don't include "I" or write in a narrative format.
- Be explanatory and to-the-point. Avoid long introductions/conclusions.
- Articles should mainly be about concepts and skills. Avoid talking about specific locations, products, or people when possible.

## Sidebar Labels

- Sidebar labels should be kept as short as possible while still communicating the purpose of the page. They should usually be shorter than the title of the article.

## Headings

- The heading heirarchy starts at the `h2` (##) level. The page title is an `h1` (#).
- Keep headings short. `h2` (##) and `h3` (###) headings will appear in the article outline. Preview the table of contents and rephrase to shorten headings if the sidebar entry looks too long.
- Headings shouldn't have punctuation.
- Headings should be written in [title case](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case).
