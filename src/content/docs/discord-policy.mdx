This is a reference guide for moderation on The Great Outdoors. It covers the responsibilities of a moderator and lays out the server's moderation policies.

## Moderator Responsibilities

### Model the Rules

Moderators should follow the server rules closely themselves. If users see you bending the rules, they will consider you a hypocrite when you enforce those same rules on others.

### Be Professional

From Discord Moderator Academy:

> The presence of a moderator should never make people uncomfortable - there needs to be a fine line between “I can chat with this moderator like with any other member” and “This is a moderator and I need to take what they're saying seriously".
>
> Ultimately, moderators should strive to be seen fondly by server members, yet respected in their positions of authority. Moderators that fail to enforce rules will be seen as unprofessional or “pushovers” by the server members, while moderators that enforce rules too strictly and/or do not participate in chat will be seen as aloof, aggressive, or out of touch.

### Have Integrity

If you notice yourself getting agitated at a user, take a minute to step away and calm down. Never moderate a user in retaliation, only when you're calm and able to make good decisions. You can always ask another mod to step in for you.

Always try to make fair moderation decisions and treat all users equally. Our job is to enable a welcoming and helpful community, not to punish users!

### Maintain a United Front

We are the united face of the server; disagreements between staff should be handled in the staff chat. Don’t share information from private channels.

## Moderator Votes

Votes are held between moderators in the #votes channel to make certain decisions. Each mod may choose one of the options or abstain.

## Command Reference

### Enabling Slowmode

In some situations, e.g. an argument involving several users, it may be helpful to enable slowmode on a channel using the `/slowmode` command. This will be logged to `#modlog.

### Handling a Raid

In the event of a large raid, use the `/secure` command to lock down the server. `/slowmode` may also be helpful. Ban any users involved in the raid and delete their messages. Once finished, remove the lockdown and any slowmodes applied.

### Tickets

A ticket is a private chat within the server. Users open tickets to ask questions, ask for special roles, and report things. Staff can use tickets to give warnings or resolve arguments between users. To open a ticket, use `/tickets open`. Don't put anything too sensitive in the subject line since other users can see it even if they aren't added to the ticket.

Once the ticket is open you'll see a message explaining the rest of the commands, such as how to add users or close the ticket. Make sure you close the ticket when it's done to keep things uncluttered. Keep in mind that non-staff can't see the ticket log once it's closed. Before you close a ticket, make sure any non-staff in the ticket have had sufficient time to see all the messages.

### Infractions

Log infractions using `/infraction`. Simply select the user, the rule broken, and optionally add a comment. The bot will automatically apply the correct action based on the moderation policy.

### Non-standard Timeouts

If you need to apply a non-standard timeout because of a special case vote, use `/timeout`.
